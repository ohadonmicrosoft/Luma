# Luma E-commerce Infrastructure

This directory contains the infrastructure configuration for the Luma e-commerce platform. We've chosen a simplified, developer-friendly approach that still provides the necessary capabilities for a premium e-commerce platform.

## Overview

Instead of the complex infrastructure setup described in the implementation plan (Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes), we've opted for a more streamlined approach using managed services:

1. **Frontend Deployment**: Vercel (Next.js specialized hosting)
2. **Backend Deployment**: Render (simplified container deployment)
3. **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL via Render
4. **Caching**: Managed Redis via Render
5. **Storage & CDN**: Cloudinary for image management and optimization
6. **Monitoring**: Sentry + LogRocket for a comprehensive but simpler monitoring approach

## Directory Structure

- `/vercel`: Configuration for Vercel deployment of the frontend
- `/render`: Configuration for Render deployment of the backend and databases
- `/storage`: Configuration for Cloudinary and other storage services
- `/monitoring`: Configuration for Sentry, LogRocket, and other monitoring tools

## Deployment Process

### Frontend (Vercel)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Use the `vercel.json` configuration in this directory
3. Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy with `git push` to your main branch

### Backend (Render)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Use the `render.yaml` configuration in this directory
3. Set up environment variables in the Render dashboard
4. Deploy with `git push` to your main branch

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Simplified DevOps**: No need to manage Kubernetes clusters or complex AWS infrastructure
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing with most services having generous free tiers
- **Developer Friendly**: Focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure
- **Scalable**: All services can scale to handle increased load
- **Secure**: Managed services handle many security concerns automatically

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Error Tracking**: Sentry captures and aggregates errors
- **User Experience**: LogRocket provides session replay and frontend monitoring
- **Performance**: Both tools provide performance monitoring capabilities

## Future Considerations

If the application grows significantly, you might consider:

1. Moving to a more customized infrastructure with Terraform and AWS/GCP
2. Implementing Kubernetes for more complex scaling needs
3. Setting up a more comprehensive monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana

However, the current setup should be sufficient for most e-commerce needs and can scale to handle significant traffic.
