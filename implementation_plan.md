<think>I need to enhance the implementation plan by integrating specific technical details, UI/UX elements, layout specifications, and service integrations from the project design document. I'll expand each relevant section with these details while maintaining the overall structure of the implementation plan.

The approach I'll take:

1. Review the project design document for technical specifications, UI/UX details, layout information, and service integrations
2. Integrate these details into the appropriate phases of the implementation plan
3. Ensure the enhanced plan maintains a logical flow and proper dependencies
4. Format the output as a markdown file

Let me focus on key areas to enhance:

- Add specific technologies, libraries, and frameworks
- Include UI/UX implementation details for each frontend component
- Specify layout requirements for different pages
- Detail external service integrations
- Add specific tools for development, testing, and deployment</think># Comprehensive Implementation Plan for Luma E-Commerce Platform
